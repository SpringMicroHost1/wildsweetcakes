                Welcome to Wild Sweet Cakes! I provide a variety of scratch baked goods for the Coeur d’Alene/Spokane vicinity.

                Wild Sweet Cakes started in my kitchen baking for friends and family. Soon my friends and family started referring me to their friends and family. I am self-taught baker that loves how sweet treats make a special occasion even more special. Baking brings me so much joy and I love being a part of my customer’s special day.

                I bake anything from my signature cupcakes and cakes to French macarons, pies, cookies and cheesecakes. I use “real” ingredients! No margarine, or imitation flavorings in these delicious baked creations.
